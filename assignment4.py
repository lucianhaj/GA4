    This file contains the template for Assignment4.  For testing it, I will place it
    in a different directory, call the function <first_second_third_mst>, and check its output.
    So, you can add/remove  whatever you want to/from this file.  But, don't change the name
    of the file or the name/signature of the following function.

    Also, I will use <python3> to run this code.
